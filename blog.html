	<h3>Thursday, May 13, 2021</h3>
	<p>Hiya! As I write this, it's currently a little past midnight, but I'm gonna count this for the 13th since
	I'm fairly sure I'll write tomorrow. I've just had the time of my life setting this computer up, so I figure
	I'll tell you about it. It's this old Gateway thing from like 2001-ish and it shipped with Windows ME which
	is a really not-great operating system I'm told. So I think, "Hmm... I'll just put 2000 on it and then bam
	I'll be good. <i>That was not the case.</i> My first hurdle was the monitor, a Packard Bell (Rememember them?)
	CRT from 1996. This monitor was the one my father used back in the day on the same computer he met my mother 
	using. Fun stuff. But that's besides the point. This thing is kinda gross. Now, I'm a grown man, I can handle
	gross. What I could not handle was clicking, and this thing was clicking! So, I consulted the internet about
	it and it turns out that's the high voltage failing. You may ask, "Syd, please enlighten us with your stolen
	wisdom!" and to that I'd say, "It means it'll go boom." So, I had to switch to a 16:9 (Someday I gotta rant
	about how much I <i>despise</i> widescreen) LCD I found lying around. This wasn't much of a hassle, but I'm a
	huge jerk or something so I'm still gonna complain.</p>
	<p>So, that brings me to my next problem: Windows 2000. I'm not a computer genius and I hope nobody who reads
	this is because I am going to make myself sound like an idiot. First time I try to install, it gets to the part
	where it reboots and there's nothing! It just hangs at the BIOS. So I do what any reasonable person would do and
	install DOS 7, then Windows 98 SE (relavent later), THEN and only then can I upgrade to Windows 2000. I didn't
	even know it was possible. But then, disaster strikes! It doesn't work! I swear to god I did all this probably
	5 or 6 times. So, after trying a few more .iso files, I give up. Then, it hits me: I already installed Windows
	98 SE and it worked okay(or at least okay-ish, we'll get to that)! First try doesn't work due to me fucking up
	the DOS 7 setup, so on the second go, I finally get it. But then, foolishness prevails and I decide to use the 
	Gateway restore discs that came with the system. After a few more hours wasted, I go back to 98 SE and realize
	that I have 3 big problems that I noticed. First was that there was no USB support. This was the easiest thing
	to fix as it was just a single executable and a reboot. Second, there was no audio. Not sure exactly what I'm 
	gonna do about this, so we'll leave it for now. Third, there was only 16 colors. At this point I was tired and
	close to just giving up, but I'm glad I kept working. After about 300,000 tries, I finally thought of something.
	Remember the Gateway System Restore disks? They had drivers on them! I guess Gateway was just lazy or something,
	but it looks like these disks have software for 98, ME, and 2000, so that's fun. But, after around 10 minutes,
	I got it working nearly perfectly. There's still some infrequent screen glitching going on, I'm not even sure 
	how to describe it, but it's not really noticeable enough to really make me wanna change it. So, that's the story
	of how I fixed up the old Gateway. I might not be able to update til Sunday since I'm working, but I'll be back 
	soon enough and I'm hoping to get a new job soon where I can do this stuff more often if that makes sense. Anyways,
	goodnight everyone! I'm beat. 
	
	PS. Stay tuned for pics 
	PPS. Audio is fixed I think!!!
	<h3>Wednesday, May 12, 2021</h3>
	<p>This is a test of the blog function of my website. Today I worked on my website and, as of writing, I've
	finished 3 pages: the homepage, the about me section, and the blog. Hopefully I can get it all done either 
	today or tomorrow! The new hard drive for my other computer arrives tomorrow and I will install Windows 2000
	on it and then I can not be distracted by all the tantalizing LCD screen stuff.</p>
